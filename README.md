# Dollar Loans (Texas CAB) — Website + Portal (V1 Scaffold)

This repo is a **Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind** scaffold for **Dollar Loans**, built with **Texas Credit Access Business (CAB)** compliant, CAB-first terminology.

## Local dev

1. Install deps: `npm install`
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Open: `http://localhost:3000`

## Notes

- Copy is intentionally **CAB-safe** (Dollar Loans facilitates access to credit; it does not present itself as a traditional lender).
- Auth + data are **mocked** for V1 scaffolding.
